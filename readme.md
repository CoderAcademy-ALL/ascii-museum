# THE ASCII MUSEUM

After many fads such as Tamagotchis, NFTs, Crypto Currencies the world finally settled on ASCII art. For 200 years a Google Drive was used. The ASCII art flourished. 

One day Google decided that they owned all of the ASCII art on the Google Drive. The artists protested and took their concerns to the Intergalactic High Court. The judge ruled in favour of Google as the artists could not prove that they created the art.

The artists fled the Google Drive. A brilliant engineer, Linus Torvald then developed a tool that could keep track of every contribution. This tool was named Git. A repository was created simply known as The ASCII museum

# THE CLONED WORLDS

For years the artists all worked directly on the origin of the ASCII museum repository. As more and more artists joined conflicts broke out as the artists needed the whole ASCII museum to themsleves to maximise creativity. 

It was decided that each artist would get their own clone of the entire ASCII museum so each of them could work in isolation. Over the following years thousands more artists joined, each of them getting a perfect replica of the ASCII museum. 

Once the art was finished a ritual known as pushing was performed where the new ASCII art was sent back to the origin. This would apply all of the changes the the original ASCII museum.


# THE CONTINUOUS HUB

Insurrection...

Google planted spies into the ASCII museum who started doing rogue pushes destroying the integrity of the ASCII Museum. Some of the artists started to return to the Google Drive.

To protect the ASCII Museum a new temple was built, known as GitHub. The pushing ritual was abandoned and replaced a new ritual, the pull request. 

GitHub introduced new processes to stop the Google spies. A new system evolved called continuous integration that would verify every single piece of art.
